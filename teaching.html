<h3>Spring 2019</h3>
<h4>Lab Instructor-  Introduction to Computing for Engineers(Python), CSE-1010</h4>
<p>
This  course introduces  computing logic, algorithmic thinking, computing processes, a programming language and computing environment. Knowledge obtained in this course enables use of the computer as an instrument to solve computing problems. Representative problems from science, mathematics, and engineering will be solved.
</p>




<h3>Spring 2017</h3>
<h4>Teaching Assistant -  Algorithms (graduate level), CSE 5500</h4>
<p>This  graduate course explores the design and analysis of
 algorithms.The course  covers fundamental design techniques and related issues such as amortized analysis, linear programming, network flow, NP-Completeness, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, parameterized algorithm, advanced data structures, and parallel algorithms.</p>

<h3>Spring 2015, Fall 2016</h3>
<h4>Teaching Assistant - Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithms, CSE 2100</h4>
<p>
This  course explores fundamental concepts of data structures and the algorithms that proceed from them. Implementation and use of linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, priority queues, heaps and graphs. Emphasis on recursion, abstract data types, object oriented design, and associated algorithms and complexity issues. Design using specifications and requirements. Basic computer organizations, including memory organizations and allocations issues. Programming assignments.</p>

<h3>Fall 2015, Spring 2017</h3>
<h4>Teaching Assistant - Theory of Computation, CSE 3502</h4>
<p>
This  course covers formal models of computation, such as finite state automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines, and their corresponding elements in formal languages (regular, context-free, recursively enumerable). The complexity hierarchy. Church's thesis and undecidability. NP completeness. Theoretical basis of design and compiler construction.</p>

<h3>Fall 2014</h3>
<h4>Teaching Assistant - Programming Language Translation, CSE 4100</h4>
<p>
This  course introduces to the formal definition of programming language syntax and semantics. Design and realization of programming language processing systems such as assemblers, compilers, and interpreters.</p>

<h3>Spring 2014</h3>
<h4>Teaching Assistant - Introduction to Discrete Systems, CSE 2500.</h4>
<p>
